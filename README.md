# Private_School_Project

This is my first project on Python Language.The aim of this project is to make a structure of a private school, that recieves  user inputs about Students (Firts Name, Last Name,Date of Birth, Course) and Trainers (Firts Name, Last Name,Course).
The output depends on users choice(yes or no) and the outputs would be:
